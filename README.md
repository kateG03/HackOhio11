# MyIndoorNav
[Team] Mannys Angels
Submission for the Honda Sponsor Challenge in HackOH\IO 11.

Our application, MyIndoorNav, allows users to navigate a building using nodes to represent points of interests. These nodes are located via coordinates.

We wrote out application mainly in Dart, as well as some additional elements in Ruby & MATLAB. We used Flutter in order to have one codebase for multiple platforms. Other than User Skylar S, this was all our first time using Dart & Flutter. 

Issues we ran into were compliation issues within Dart due to inexperience with the language. The algorithims & equations were difficult to derive as well.

If given more time, we would have implemented a "Crowd mode" with a different, more intuitive UI. You can see the mockups in Mockups.pdf provided in assets. We would have created more nodes in order to provide a fuller map, and more locations that this application can run in (more buildings). We would also spend more time making our codebase modular. We would implement for all floors, the shortest path to each node (point of interest/room), rather than just Floor 1. We would have also implemented a QR code scanner. In theory, this QR code would auto-select the Union and take the user to the Destination screen.
