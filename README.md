# MyIndoorNav
[Team] Mannys Angels
Submission for the Honda Sponsor Challenge in HackOH\IO 11.

Our application, MyIndoorNav, allows users to navigate a building using nodes to represent points of interests. These nodes are located via coordinates.

We wrote out application mainly in Dart, as well as some additional elements in Ruby & MATLAB. We used Flutter in order to have one codebase for multiple platforms. Other than User Skylar S, this was all our first time using Dart & Flutter. 

Issues we ran into were compliation issues within Dart due to inexperience with the language. The algorithims & equations were difficult to derive as well.

If given more time, we would have implemented a "Crowd mode" with a different, more intuitive UI. You can see the mockups in Mockups.pdf provided in assets. We would have created more nodes in order to provide a fuller map, and more locations that this application can run in (more buildings). We would also spend more time making our codebase modular.

We also implemented a QR code scanner, however this was just proof of concept as we did not have a QR code for our application specifically for The Ohio State Union.
